      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hi, John here.</p>
      <p>A graduate from Egerton University with a bachelor's degree in Ecotourism management incorporated with IT. I have worked for internship at Safari Plains Africa Limited, a tour company. I worked with the tour team as well as the reservations team.</p>
      <p>Currently, I am an upcoming computer programmer from Moringa School.</p>
      <p>I decided to join programming school because my profession when incorporated with tech, it is the best way to go.These are some of the reasons why I decided to go tech way:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>environmental agencies that advertise on responsible tourism needs technological platforms to reach a large audience and do environmental monitoring</li>
        <li>Tour companies and hotels need good websites in order to get clents</li>
        <li>The current job and busines industry is very much tied to technology and without tech means no business.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>My hobbies</h3>
      <p>Feel free to interract with me. I love fun. Some of my hobbies include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I love playing football. That is a bit of a joke, I am not a very good footballer,haha.</li>
        <li>I am a good keyboard player, oh yea, that is true. I love music</li>
        <li>I love travelling, though I can't remember the last day I travelled since I code the whole day, no another lie don't mind.</li>
