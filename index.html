      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hi, John here.</p>
      <p>A graduate from Egerton University with a bachelor's degree in Ecotourism management incorporated with IT. I have worked for internship at Safari Plains Africa Limited, a tour company. I worked with the tour team as well as the reservations team.</p>
      <p>Currently, I am an upcoming computer programmer from Moringa School.</p>
      <p>I decided to join programming school because my profession when incorporated with tech, it is the best way to go.These are some of the reasons why I decided to go tech way:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>environmental agencies that advertise on responsible tourism needs technological platforms to reach a large audience and do environmental monitoring</li>
        <li>Tour companies and hotels need good websites in order to get clents</li>
        <li>The current job and busines industry is very much tied to technology and without tech means no business.</li>
      </ul>
